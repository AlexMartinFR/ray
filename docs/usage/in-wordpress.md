Support for WordPress is in active development. 

You'll find the source code of the WordPress in [this repo](https://github.com/spatie/wordpress-ray). We haven't released a stable release just yet. If you want to help out, we appreciate PRs that add functionality at the repo.

You can use all methods from [the framework agnostic version](/docs/ray/v1/usage/in-a-framework-agnostic-project).
